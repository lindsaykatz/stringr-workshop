11132,,"Hunt, Greg MP",00AMV,Flinders,LP,"Mr HUNT (Flinders—Minister for Health and Aged Care) (14:33):  I want to thank the member for Mackellar and acknowledge that his electorate has achieved a 95 per cent double dosed vaccination rate, and that's helping to save lives and protect lives as the vaccination program is around Australia. Indeed, just in the last 24 hours there were another 650,000 cases worldwide and over 7,300 lives lost officially. So the pandemic, which some would almost pretend is not a pandemic but uniquely an Australian event, is in fact a global pandemic which has wreaked profound impact around the world. Thankfully, Australia has had one of the highest vaccination rates in the world, one of the lowest losses of life in the world—with over 30,000 lives saved by comparison with the OECD average, and 45,000 lives saved by comparison with those agonies we've seen in the great nations of the United States and the United Kingdom—and one of the strongest economic recoveries. All these things have come together.The programs we put in place to protect Australians—borders, testing, tracing, distancing and the vaccination program—have worked together through these rings of containment to give Australians some of the strongest outcomes of any nation in the world. Let us never forget, as a parliament, that of all the nations in the world Australia is one of the few with a loss of life that is so limited. Each life lost is to be deeply regretted but no nation is immune. But few nations have done better than Australia. That's what is fundamentally important.As we face the latest news about the omicron variant, we know that the very systems that were established on our watch, in our time, have been put in place immediately. On Saturday, off the back of the briefing with the Chief Medical Officer and the health secretary, the Prime Minister instructed: that we take steps to cease flights from the southern African nations; that we, sadly, put in place a pause on non-Australian arrivals from the southern African nations; that we ensure there is quarantine for those who have been in the southern African nations; and that we ensure that all those who had already arrived in Australia were put in quarantine. These elements have come together. They are saving lives and protecting lives now. Additional measures have been taken by the National Security Committee overnight with regard to new arrivals and pausing those for 14 days. Together these actions are protecting Australia and continuing to protect Australia."
11133,,"Payne, Alicia MP",144732,Canberra,ALP,"Ms PAYNE (Canberra) (14:37):  My question is to the Prime Minister. Can the Prime Minister confirm that, in a report released this month, the Prime Minister's handpicked quarantine adviser, Jane Halton, told him 'purpose-built facilities represent the gold standard of quarantine' and 'monitoring variants of concern should ensure high-risk travellers are allocated to these purpose-built facilities'? Can the Prime Minister confirm he has failed to establish a single purpose-built quarantine facility?"
11133,,"Morrison, Scott MP",E3L,Cook,LP,"Mr MORRISON (Cook—Prime Minister) (14:37):  I thank the member for her question. We are doing exactly that, as recommended. I reinforce what I've already said to this House. Over the course of this pandemic the arrangements we put in place, unlike other countries—the Minister for Health has just made the reference to OECD countries. Had we gone down the same path and not taken the steps we did take, more than 30,000 Australians would be dead today. Thirty thousand Australians would have perished in this pandemic were it not for the timely and effective measures this government put in place, working with the states and territories to ensure that result. And not only that but, with the economic strength this country has shown through the course of this pandemic, some 350,000 people are coming back into work. We ensured that the structure and strength of our economy was maintained through the pandemic so it can be springing back now, after the lockdowns are over, and we are seeing Australians going back into work.I was talking to the Confederation of Australian Industry this morning. Throughout the pandemic Australian businesses were taking advantage of the investment allowances we put in place in the budget to set up for the economic recovery. Their vote of confidence in the Australian economy in the midst of a pandemic shows great character, great resilience and fortitude, and that is what is setting up the opportunity in the years ahead. But we cannot take that economic recovery for granted. Australia must secure this economic recovery, and that requires the continued economic policy settings which our government has put in place for a business led recovery, for an enterprise led recovery, for an entrepreneur led recovery—not having government crowd that out, as those opposite would do in not understanding when it's time for governments to step back so Australians and Australian businesses can step forward. The higher-taxing DNA of the Labor Party will only risk that recovery, and that's why we must secure that recovery with the policies of our government."
11133,,"McIntosh, Melissa MP",281513,Lindsay,LP,Mrs McINTOSH (Lindsay) (14:40):  My question is to the Minister for Home Affairs. Will the minister please update the House on how the Morrison government is dealing with the challenges of the omicron variant while continuing to ensure the safe reopening of our international borders as part of our plan to secure Australia's economic recovery and return to our way of life?
11133,,"Andrews, Karen MP",230886,McPherson,LNP,"Mrs ANDREWS (McPherson—Minister for Home Affairs) (14:40):  I thank the member for her question and also for her great advocacy in Western Sydney on a wide range of issues, including a number of matters in home affairs. Late last week we became aware of the omicron variant, which presents a range of new challenges for us here in Australia and also globally. It's very early days. The world is yet to have a complete understanding of it. Here in Australia we need to learn more about that particular variant.That's why this government took the very sensible step last night to place a two-week pause on stage 2 of our planned border reopening from 1 December. It will be a 14-day pause from 1 December for a number of cohorts that we had previously indicated we were going to be able to open to. Those cohorts include economic workers, skilled workers, international students and humanitarian and refugee temporary visa holders. Also we have had to pause our reopening to citizens of Japan and South Korea. That pause will be in place for a period of 14 days to make sure that there is time in Australia particularly for our health professionals to understand more about this new variant.This is not a decision that the government took lightly. We know that many plans had been made. We know that businesses are desperately wanting skilled workers and they need those skilled workers here. We know that visa holders in Australia want to be able to see loved ones, many of whom are overseas and they have been separated from for a very long period of time and many of those people want to come to Australia to visit us here. So we are very mindful of the impact that those border changes have on many individuals, on many families and on many businesses here in Australia. We certainly feel for all of those who have been affected.But we took this very sensible and this very prudent decision based on health advice. That advice was that we needed to put in place a pause on the next stage of reopening our international borders. The Morrison government are absolutely committed to doing all that we can to reopen those borders as soon as we possibly can, but we need to do that in a very safe and considered manner. That's why the decision was taken last night that we would pause the international arrivals that we had planned to allow into this country as of 1 December.We need to be very conscious as we move forward that we need to bring in those skilled workers. Again, the Morrison government will do all that it can to make sure that we open our international borders as safely and as quickly as we can. (Time expired)"
11134,,"Albanese, Anthony, MP",R36,Grayndler,ALP,Mr ALBANESE (Grayndler—Leader of the Opposition) (14:43):  My question is to the Prime Minister. The 2022 parliamentary calendar of the Morrison-Joyce government has in practice only 10 sitting days for the House and five for the Senate before August. Doesn't this show the Prime Minister has no intention of establishing a federal anti-corruption commission before the election?
11134,,"Morrison, Scott MP",E3L,Cook,LP,"Mr MORRISON (Cook—Prime Minister) (14:44):  The Leader of the Opposition knows full well that we have 349 pages of legislation and $150 million committed to this measure. All it would take is for the Labor Party to support it, which they don't. They have a two-page policy. We have a 349-page set of legislation. If they wished to support it, we would welcome that.But I'm asked also about the parliamentary calendar, which I know is a topic that the Leader of the Opposition has been taking a keen interest in. The Leader of the Opposition may not be aware that, in order to prepare a budget next year, the normal practice is to ensure there are a set number of weeks for the preparation of that budget before the budget is delivered. As the Leader of the Opposition may not be aware, in order to prepare a budget next year the normal practice is to ensure there are a set number of weeks before the preparation of that budget and before the budget is delivered. I have personally delivered three budgets as Treasurer and three budgets as Prime Minister, and I have served seven years on the Expenditure Review Committee. I can understand why the Leader of the Opposition would be unfamiliar with the time taken to prepare a budget, because he's never delivered one. There are people who have been serving refreshments in the Expenditure Review Committee longer than this person, the Leader of the Opposition, spent in that chamber. Our government knows how important the economic recovery for this country is as we emerge from the pandemic. We have the economic management experience to ensure that we secure that recovery. Last year's budget set out once again the further iteration of that economic recovery plan—the economic recovery plan that has already seen 217,000 Australians currently in trade apprenticeships and training right now, which is the highest level on record since 1963. The SPEAKER:  The Leader of the Opposition, on a point of order?Mr Albanese:  Mr Speaker, the point of order is on relevance. The question was about an anticorruption commission and whether the government has any intention of introducing and dealing with that legislation prior to the next election. The SPEAKER:  The question was posed also in relation to the 2022 parliamentary calendar. The Prime Minister is on point in relation to the calendar. The Prime Minister has the call. Mr MORRISON:  That economic recovery, as we go into next year and we do the preparations for next year's budget, will continue to support measures that keep Australians in work. Under our government, there are a million Australians who are working in manufacturing today. I was in Adelaide on Friday when I met former Holden workers now working in manufacturing again, in the medical industry.The SPEAKER:  The Manager of Opposition Business, on a point of order?Mr Burke:  Mr Speaker, you ruled before that the Prime Minister would be in order if he was talking about the parliamentary calendar or the anticorruption commission. I don't see how this is either, or even close to either. The SPEAKER:  You're point of order is in relation to relevance—Mr Burke:  Well, it's in relation to your previous ruling. I wouldn't be allowed to make one on relevance.The SPEAKER:  You've already made the point on relevance. The Manager of Opposition Business will resume his seat. The Prime Minister will be relevant to the question.Mr MORRISON:  I can understand why the member for Watson also does not understand why it is relevant that you need to set a calendar which enables you to bring down a budget that is absolutely critical to the economic recovery of this country. Those opposite don't understand budgets. They don't understand economic management, and the Australian people do not trust them on economic management. That's why, when they look at these things, all they see the parliament for is an opportunity to come in here and play their little parliamentary games.Ms McBain interjecting—The SPEAKER:  The member for Eden-Monaro is warned.Mr MORRISON:  In government, the job is to put together a budget—The SPEAKER:  The Manager of Opposition Business, on a point of order?Mr Burke:  I am just letting you know that the time expired some time ago.The SPEAKER:  Before I call the member for Ryan, the interjections from both sides of the House are far too high. One member has received a warning. I will start acting under 94(a)."
11135,,"Simmonds, Julian MP",282983,Ryan,LNP,"Mr SIMMONDS (Ryan) (14:48):  My question is to the Minister for Defence. Will the minister please update the House on how the Morrison governments partnership with the United States and the United Kingdom is ensuring that Australia can meet the threats posed by the changing strategic environment, and is the minister aware of any alternative approaches?"
11135,,"Dutton, Peter Craig MP",00AKI,Dickson,LNP,"Mr DUTTON (Dickson—Minister for Defence and Leader of the House) (14:49):  I thank the honourable member for Ryan for his question and acknowledge the hard work that he does in his local community supporting all of those that work and live on the barracks at Enoggera—the Gallipoli Barracks—and the strong support that he provides to those veterans and to their families. As we know, the Indo-Pacific is witnessing a dramatic military build-up. We know that the Chinese government has 355 vessels—boats and submarines. They will have an increase in that number to 460 by the end of 2030. And we know that, over an 18-month period, at the moment, they're producing, on a tonnage rate, more in their naval fleet than what the—Mr Khalil interjecting—The SPEAKER:  The member for Wills is warned.Mr DUTTON:  Royal Australian Navy has in its entire fleet. We know that, overnight, the United States released its global force posture review, and that review—Mr Watts interjecting—The SPEAKER:  The member for Gellibrand is warned. Mr DUTTON:  directs additional cooperation with allies and partners to contribute to Indo-Pacific stability—Dr Leigh interjecting—The SPEAKER:  The member for Fenner is warned.Mr DUTTON:  and deter potential Chinese military aggression. This is why the Australian government has entered into the AUKUS arrangement with both the United States and the United Kingdom, to make sure that we can take steps to keep our country safe and secure now and into the future. And, as part of the deal on AUKUS, we have of course announced that we are going to acquire, to build, at least eight nuclear propelled submarines. That gives them the stealth and the ability to operate in the Indo-Pacific to protect our country and our interests and the interests of our friends. Part of that process means that there needs to be a consultation through the IAEA, the International Atomic Energy Agency, to sign off on the deal. There has been some opposition, and I note that there is some opposition from those opposite. As we know, on national security this Leader of the Opposition always plays both sides of the fence. There's always an each-way bet on national security by the Labor Party. In here, they say they're in support of AUKUS, and when they get outside they tell a very different story. I noticed yesterday that the member for Fremantle, in relation to this IAEA process, in relation to our country, Australia, said that 'we will have broken new ground in weakening the existing non-proliferation regime'. Now, those words sounded familiar, because when you look at those that have contributed through the process at the energy agency, there are only two other countries that are making a claim that Australia is not doing the right thing here. That is the Chinese government and the Russian government—those two. So, Comrade Wilson, you're on message, and 'weak leader' here would be very proud of you. Mr Albanese:  I seek leave to move the following motion:That the House declares our support for our alliances with the United States and the United Kingdom.The SPEAKER:  Is leave granted? Mr Dutton:  You don't grant leave to stunts, and I tell you what: you could speak here all day and you wouldn't convince the Australian public you're strong! The SPEAKER:  I give the call to the member for Sydney. Honourable members interjecting—The SPEAKER:  Order! Members on my left! If members on my left and members on my right want me to hear the question, they'll stop their interjections. The member for Sydney has the call."
11136,,"Plibersek, Tanya Joan MP",83M,Sydney,ALP,"Ms PLIBERSEK (Sydney) (14:53):  My question is to the Prime Minister. Does the Prime Minister's model of a national anticorruption commission have the power to investigate the energy minister's use of forged documents to attack the Lord Mayor of Sydney? The SPEAKER:  The Leader of the House has the call.Mr Dutton:  Mr Speaker, the standing orders are very clear in relation to those sorts of baseless allegations, impugning a member of this House, and they are false allegations, unfounded, and it should be withdrawn. The SPEAKER:  I am happy to hear from the Manager of Opposition Business. Mr Burke:  Mr Speaker, it's been the case for quite some time that, if a minister wants to reject something within a question, they have the opportunity to do so in the answer. The question does not assert something as fact; it asks a question.The SPEAKER:  The Manager of Opposition Business will resume his seat. Standing order 100(d)(iv) talks about imputations, and certainly there's an imputation in that question. I am happy to give the questioner the opportunity to reword the question.Ms PLIBERSEK:  My question is to the Prime Minister. Does the Prime Minister's model of a national anticorruption commission have the power to investigate the use of forged documents to attack a lord mayor?"
11137,,"Fletcher, Paul MP",L6B,Bradfield,LP,"Mr FLETCHER (Bradfield—Minister for Communications, Urban Infrastructure, Cities and the Arts) (14:55):  I thank the Prime Minister for the opportunity to respond to the question asked by the member for Sydney. Our model will deal with allegations of serious criminal corruption at the Commonwealth level. That is what our model will do. It's a well-developed, serious, substantiated model, and if the opposition were serious about engaging in it—Ms Kearney interjecting—The SPEAKER:  The member for Cooper is warned.Mr FLETCHER:  if the opposition were serious about tackling the risk and challenge of—Mr Perrett interjecting—Mr FLETCHER:  suspected serious criminal corruption at the Commonwealth level—The SPEAKER:  The member for Moreton is warned.Mr FLETCHER:  they would engage seriously with this government on what we've put, on the full text, the 349 pages of legislation which have been out there for many months, rather than engage in a series of political stunts. One side of this House is genuine and serious minded about engaging on the issue of suspected Commonwealth criminal corruption. One side of this House has a detailed exposure draft of legislation which is out there, ready to go. The other side of this House is sitting on its hands doing nothing. Those opposite need to take a good hard look at themselves."
