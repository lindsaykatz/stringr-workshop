# stringr-workshop

This repository contains materials for the Introduction to Strings Workshop.

The `docs` folder contains the workshop learning material (`stringr_intro`) and exercise solutions (`stringr_solutions`) in both `Rmd` and `html` forms.

The `data` folder contains one `csv` file, `hansard_ex.csv`, which is a subset of 10 speechs from the Australian Parliamentary debates on November 30th 2021 in the House of Representatitves. These data were parsed directly from the publicly available XML Hansard transcript.
